                <h2>This project that took me to Apple Park</h2>
				<p><strong>What</strong>: For this Swift Student Challenge in 2022, I recreated some furniture ideas using tennis balls to repurpose them, building pieces like this tennis ball pet bed and this WWDC wood table. I also love spatial design, so I made a Playground app to visualize these furniture pieces in your own space using ARKit.</p>
				<p><strong>Why</strong>: I love 3D modeling and interior design. In a design class, we had to create a 3D model of anything we wanted. I initially wanted to create a 3D-printed tennis racket for personal use, but my professor suggested that instead of making something I already had, I should try recycling my old tennis balls.</p>
				<p><strong>Fun Fact</strong>: Since 2020, participating in the WWDC Swift Student Challenge has become my passion. I've joined it five times in a row since then, receiving four rejections and one acceptance in 2022. I love it because it pushes me out of my comfort zone every time.</p>

                <h2>Industrial Designer</h2>
				<p><strong>What</strong>: A headphone that gives back your confidence. Itâ€™s way more comfortable because it doesnâ€™t crush your ears or head. Itâ€™s more compact, so you can take it anywhere you want. Perfect for gaming, listening to music, working, studying, and even exercising.</p>
				<p><strong>Why</strong>: The headphone industry overlooks people with curly hair. Regular headphones donâ€™t fit well, hair gets stuck, and some people donâ€™t feel confident wearing them because they flatten their hair, ruining the look.</p>
				<p><strong>Contributions</strong>: Even though I brought this project from idea to prototype, it wouldnâ€™t have been possible without so many people sharing their headphone struggles. Shout out to Guil Anacleto, Marcelo Augusto, Andreza Delgado, and Luiza Arantes!</p>

                <h2>My first client for a software automation service</h2>
                <p><strong>What</strong>: I teamed up with a developer friend and posted in a Telegram group: "If you need any service to automate your operations, reach out to me." Guess what? Around ten people texted me. And boom, I closed my first deal that month.</p>
              	<p><strong>Why</strong>: I have been seeking financial freedom for a couple of years and believe there's only one way to achieve it: hard work. So, I built my own company. At the time, I was working for an e-commerce company and noticed that many other e-commerce businesses in the Telegram community faced issues with manual operations in their daily routines.</p>
            	<p><strong>Fun Fact</strong>: I didn't have a company at the time; I was literally an amateur. My first client asked me for an invoice, which required having a company. So, I "faked it till I made it." I told my client I could provide an invoice at the end of the month-long service. During that month, I built my company and was able to issue an official invoice.</p>
